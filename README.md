# Toronto Auto Theft Analysis
This project takes the public dataset provided by the Toronto police about auto thefts and analyzes the data to gain some insights on where the thefts happen, how many thefts happen, when they happen, etc. Moreover, this project was more for me to practice my SQL querying skills.

### Tools
- pgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL)
- PowerShell (Using Git for version control on Windows 10)

### PowerBI Dashboard
The data was taken over a reporting period from 2014 to 2023. Below the dashboard shows basic trends such as theft by week, month, year, as well as whether it was stolen on a residential or commercial property.

- In 2014, residential areas accounted for 27.7% of thefts, in 2023 it accounts for 38.8% and will likely continue to increase in the coming years
